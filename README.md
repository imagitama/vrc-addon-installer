# VRC Addon Installer

A Unity plugin that automates adding and removing accessories on a VRChat avatar.

It can do the following:

- import an asset (FBX) and add it to your avatar
- merge the armatures (if the bones align)
- suffix all bones to help you find them
- remove an existing accessory (including all bones)
- prune (delete) any "loose" bones (that have no parent mesh)

## Ideas for future

- allow importing .prefab, .obj and other formats
- prune individual loose bones
